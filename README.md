# SIS-Framework-Deployer
The SIS-Framework aims to facilitate the engineering and continuous deployment of smart IoT systems, allowing decentralized processing across heterogeneous the IoT, edge and cloud space. The SIS-Framework includes: (i) a domain specific modelling language to model the orchestration and deployment of smart IoT systems across the IoT, edge and cloud spaces; and (ii) an execution engine that will support the orchestration of IoT, edge and cloud services as well as their automatic deployment over IoT, edge and cloud resources.

## Metamodel
The SIS-Framework Modelling language is inspired by component-based approaches in order to facilitate separation of concerns and reusability. In this respect, deployment models can be regarded as assemblies of components exposing ports, and bindings between these ports.
